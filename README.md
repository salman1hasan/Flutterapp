My main goal in life | Build as much as I can for UNGUARDED so this way, I can create an empire and leave it behind for my family when I get married and have kids. (Family and I) 
My religious views | Islam  
Reason Why | Own D&B Numbers and own UNGUARDED and own a revenue route UNGUARDED Sticker.  
Scaleable Consideration | Saudi Arabia [Direct me to investors and align me to the right place need be].  
Where is my revenue going | Tech [Someone who can build the app out for me] (App Agency) [Regardless religion and race best person for the job here]  
 
Main Goal | Generate revenue and/or get a job 
 
1 year development [Learn about flutter for one year]  
 
Flutter Development [Web development, iPhone, Android Development]- 301 days (about 10 months) 
Helps me create templates and think of concepts that I can use in the future. Cross dimensional app so this helps me generate an app on both iOS and android and maybe when I'm 35 I can have an app on android and apple
